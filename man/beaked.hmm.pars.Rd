\title{Alboran sea beaked whale availability HMM parameters.}
\format{A list with the following three elements.
 \describe{
   \item{\code{Pi}:}{ a 2x2x1 array containg the transition probability matrix. States can be 
   interpreted as behavioural states, one of which being a state in which the animal is more 
   likely to be available than when in the other state.}
   \item{\code{pm}:}{ a 2x1 matrix containing the vector of state-dependent Bernoulli availability 
   parameters. \code{pm[1,i]} is the probability of whale i being available given state 1 (the less 
   available behavoural state), and \code{pm[1,i]} is the probability of whale i being available given 
   state 1 (the more available behavoural state).}
   \item{\code{delta}:}{ a 2x1 matrix containing the stationary distribution of \code{Pi} for each 
   whale. So \code{delta[1,i]} is the probability that whale i is in behavioural state 1 when 
   observation starts, and \code{delta[2,i]} is the probability that it is in behavioural state 2 when 
   observation starts.}

\description{
Hidden Markov model (HMM) parameter estimates for beaked whale availability obtained 
from mean times available and unavailable observed by Ana Canadas (pers commn.) in thge Alboran sea. 
This dataset was used in the analyses of Borchers et al. (2013).
